There are several keyboard shortcuts you can use to run Python code in Visual Studio Code.

Ctrl+F5: This will run the active Python file.
Shift+Enter: This will run the selected lines or the line your cursor is on.
F5: This will run the active Python file and open a debugger window.
You can also create a custom keyboard shortcut to run Python code by opening the Keyboard Shortcuts menu (Ctrl+K+Ctrl+S) and searching for Run Python File.

Once you have found the command, you can click the Add New Binding button and enter a keyboard shortcut of your choice.

Here are some additional tips for running Python code in Visual Studio Code:

If you are working on a large project, you may want to create a separate Python environment for your project. This will help to ensure that your project's dependencies are isolated from other Python projects on your system.
You can use the Python: Start REPL command to open a Python REPL terminal. This can be useful for testing code or for interactively exploring Python objects.
You can use the Python: Debug command to start a debugger session for your active Python file. This can be useful for stepping through code and inspecting variables.
